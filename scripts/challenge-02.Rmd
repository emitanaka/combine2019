# Suppressing setup code and output

## Case study: loading `tidyverse`

If you try to load the `tidyverse` package, you get many messages.


```{r pkg-load}
library(tidyverse)
```

In writing your report, it is most likely undesirable that it

1. prints your the R code; and
1. has all the messages printed.

If you have the chunk with `eval = FALSE` then it will not print those messages but it will not _**eval**uate_ the R code within the chunk.

You can see this if we first unload the `ggplot2` pacakge that was loaded with `tidyverse` previously:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
detach("package:ggplot2", unload = TRUE)
```

then try to load the package but without evaluating the code within the chunk:

```{r pkg-load, eval = FALSE}
```

and try to run `ggplot` function

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(cars, aes(dist, speed)) +
  geom_point()
```

we get an error! This is because the chunk to load the `tidyverse` was not evaluated. 

What you want to do is to _suppress the code_ and for this you can use `echo = FALSE`.

```{r pkg-load, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
```
