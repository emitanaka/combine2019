**Learning objective** 

* `include = FALSE`

## Case study: loading `tidyverse`

If you try to load the `tidyverse` package, you get many messages.


```{r pkg-load}
library(tidyverse)
```

In writing your report, you probably do not want to

1. print the R code; and
1. print all the peripheral messages.

To achieve this you can use the chunk option:

`echo = FALSE, message = FALSE`.

`r emo::ji("question")` **Can you tell which option does what?**

`r emo::ji("wrench")` **Modify the `pkg-load` chunk to hide the code and message outputs.** 

This can be done more succintly using:

`include = FALSE`.

In fact it's equivalent to hiding code and all outputs:

`echo=FALSE, results='hide',` 
`message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,` 
`fig.show='hide'`.
