  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of functional non-coding RNA sequences has
    led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to RNA analysis.
    Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing
    reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation
    of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore
    RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into
    account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure
    alignments, which we model as an integer linear program (ILP). We
    sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the
    ILP using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results
    on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. CONCLUSION:
    The implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms
    of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: This
    is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences.

  abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
    of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative
    scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa,
    creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and
    reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node.
    Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances
    and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is
    well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences.
    At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible
    reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the
    new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose
    the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover,
    in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better
    and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties
    of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been
    performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency.
    When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence
    approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant
    among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution
    rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better
    topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and
    the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction
    is on the average around 20\%. With highly-varying-rate trees and
    with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately
    1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above
    50\%, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented
    by as much as 15\%.},

  title = {Phylogenetic reconstruction using secondary structures of Internal
    Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2, rDNA): finding the molecular and morphological
    gap in Caribbean gorgonian corals.},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {90},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused
    on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures
    are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics,
    not found in the primary sequence, that give "morphological" information.
    Despite the number of recent molecular studies on octocorals, there
    is no consensus opinion about a region that carries enough phylogenetic
    resolution to solve intrageneric or close species relationships.
    Moreover, intrageneric morphological information by itself does not
    always produce accurate phylogenies; intra-species comparisons can
    reveal greater differences than intra-generic ones. The search for
    new phylogenetic approaches, such as by RNA secondary structure analysis,
    is therefore a priority in octocoral research. RESULTS: Initially,
    twelve predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed to provide
    the basic information for phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with
    the 6 helicoidal ring model, also present in other groups of corals
    and eukaryotes. We obtained three similar topologies for nine species
    of the Caribbean gorgonian genus Eunicea (candelabrum corals) with
    two sister taxa as outgroups (genera Plexaura and Pseudoplexaura)
    on the basis of molecular morphometrics of ITS2 RNA secondary structures
    only, traditional primary sequence analyses and maximum likelihood,
    and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach
    allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics;
    each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate.
    In addition, each helix was partitioned as if it had evolved at a
    distinct rate. Plexaura flexuosa was found to group within Eunicea;
    this was best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined
    analyses. We suggest Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux, 1821) comb. nov.,
    and we present a new species description including Scanning Electron
    Microscopy (SEM) images of morphological characteristics (sclerites).
    Eunicea flexuosa, E. pallida, E. laxispica and E. mammosa formed
    a separate clade in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally
    monophyletic with respect to other Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus,
    e.g. E. tourneforti and E. laciniata) in the molecular morphometrics
    tree, with the exception of E. fusca. Moreover, we suggest a new
    diagnostic character for Eunicea, also present in E. flexuosa: middle
    layer sclerites > 1 mm in length. CONCLUSION: ITS2 was a reliable
    sequence for intrageneric studies in gorgonian octocorals because
    of the amount of phylogenetic signal, and was corroborated against
    morphological characters separating Eunicea from Plexaura. The ITS2
    RNA secondary structure approach to phylogeny presented here did
    not rely on alignment methods such as INDELS, but provided clearly
    homologous characters for partition analysis and RNA molecular morphometrics.
    These approaches support the divergence of Eunicea flexuosa comb.

    part of this outgroup for nearly two centuries because of morphological
    resemblance.},

    reliability. Structure comparison is, in analogy to sequence comparison,
    the essential technique to infer related function. We provide a method
    for computing multiple alignments of RNA secondary structures under
    the tree alignment model, which is suitable to cluster RNA molecules
    purely on the structural level, i.e., sequence similarity is not
    required. We give a systematic generalization of the profile alignment
    method from strings to trees and forests. We introduce a tree profile
    representation of RNA secondary structure alignments which allows
    reasonable scoring in structure comparison. Besides the technical
    aspects, an RNA profile is a useful data structure to represent multiple

    for this correlation is important for phylogenetic inference because
    it affects the likelihood calculation. In the present study we use
    the complete set of tRNA and rRNA sequences from 69 complete mammalian
    mitochondrial genomes. The likelihood calculation uses two evolutionary
    models simultaneously for different parts of the sequence: a paired-site
    model for the paired sites and a single-site model for the unpaired
    sites. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods and a Markov chain Monte
    Carlo algorithm is used to obtain the most probable trees and posterior
    probabilities of clades. The results are well resolved for almost
    all the important branches on the mammalian tree. They support the
    arrangement of mammalian orders within the four supra-ordinal clades
    that have been identified by studies of much larger data sets mainly
    comprising nuclear genes. Groups such as the hedgehogs and the murid
    rodents, which have been problematic in previous studies with mitochondrial

    then inherits the accuracy and robustness of profiles and the time
    efficiency of neighbor-joining. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis

    reveals seven well supported subclades, but the methods disagree
    on the basal branching pattern. The tree reconstructed by our method

    in sequence with an assumed conservation in structure. This hypothesis
    was mainly based on small-scale analyses, comparing a limited number
    of sequences. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of more than
    54,000 currently known ITS2 sequences with the goal to evaluate the
    hypothesis of a conserved structural core and to assess its use for
    automated large-scale phylogenetics. Structure prediction revealed
    that the previously described core structure can be found for more
    than 5000 sequences in a wide variety of taxa within the eukaryotes,
    indicating that the core secondary structure is indeed conserved.
    This conserved structure allowed an automated alignment of extremely

  abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is a phylogenetic marker
    which has been of broad use in generic and infrageneric level classifications,
    as its sequence evolves comparably fast. Only recently, it became
    clear, that the ITS2 might be useful even for higher level systematic
    analyses. As the secondary structure is highly conserved within all
    eukaryotes it serves as a valuable template for the construction
    of highly reliable sequence-structure alignments, which build a fundament
    for subsequent analyses. Thus, any phylogenetic study using ITS2
    has to consider both sequence and structure. We have integrated a
    homology based RNA structure prediction algorithm into a web server,
    which allows the detection and secondary structure prediction for
    ITS2 in any given sequence. Furthermore, the resource contains more
    than 25,000 pre-calculated secondary structures for the currently
    known ITS2 sequences. These can be taxonomically searched and browsed.
    Thus, our resource could become a starting point for ITS2-based phylogenetic
    analyses and is therefore complementary to databases of other phylogenetic
    markers, which focus on higher level analyses. The current version
    of the ITS2 database can be accessed via http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

    alignment and editing.}},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {498},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the
    fundament of all proceeding analyses. Errors in an alignment could
    strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead
    to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are
    necessary and meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often
    the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is
    well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently,
    some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and
    model both kinds of information. However, with the advent of a large
    amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved secondary
    structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced
    with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary
    structures synchronously. RESULTS: 4SALE fills this gap. The application
    allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment
    for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing
    of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes
    an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their
    associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4SALE
    used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and
    unique starting point for every RNA sequence and structure analysis.
    CONCLUSION: 4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive
    interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence
    and secondary structure information. The program connects sequence
    and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs
    as for example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore
    platform independent. The software is freely available and distributed
    from the website at http://4sale.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

    transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). They mainly use the fast evolving sequence
    for low-level analyses. When considering the highly conserved structure,
    the same marker could also be used for higher level phylogenies.
    Furthermore, structural features of the ITS2 allow distinguishing
    different species from each other. Despite its importance, the correct
    structure is only rarely found by standard RNA folding algorithms.
    To overcome this hindrance for a wider application of the ITS2, we
    have developed a homology modelling approach to predict the structure
    of RNA and present the results of modelling the ITS2 in the ITS2
    Database. Here, we describe the database and the underlying algorithms
    which allowed us to predict the structure for 86 784 sequences, which
    is more than 55\% of all GenBank entries concerning the ITS2. These
    are not equally distributed over all genera. There is a substantial
    amount of genera where the structure of nearly all sequences is predicted
    whereas for others no structure at all was found despite high sequence
    coverage. These genera might have evolved an ITS2 structure diverging

    into a multiple alignment and second, how to generate secondary structure
    information for sequences whose explicit structural information is
    missing. RESULTS: We describe a novel approach for multiple alignment
    of RNAs (MARNA) taking into consideration both the primary and the
    secondary structures. It is based on pairwise sequence-structure
    comparisons of RNAs. From these sequence-structure alignments, libraries
    of weighted alignment edges are generated. The weights reflect the
    sequential and structural conservation. For sequences whose secondary
    structures are missing, the libraries are generated by sampling low
    energy conformations. The libraries are then processed by the T-Coffee
    system, which is a consistency based multiple alignment method. Furthermore,
    we are able to extract a consensus-sequence and -structure from a
    multiple alignment. We have successfully tested MARNA on several
    datasets taken from the Rfam database.},

  abstract = {Empirical models of substitution are often used in protein sequence
    analysis because the large alphabet of amino acids requires that
    many parameters be estimated in all but the simplest parametric models.
    When information about structure is used in the analysis of substitutions
    in structured RNA, a similar situation occurs. The number of parameters
    necessary to adequately describe the substitution process increases
    in order to model the substitution of paired bases. We have developed
    a method to obtain substitution rate matrices empirically from RNA
    alignments that include structural information in the form of base
    pairs. Our data consisted of alignments from the European Ribosomal
    RNA Database of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Small Subunit and Large
    Subunit Ribosomal RNA ( Wuyts et al. 2001. Nucleic Acids Res. 29:175-177;
    Wuyts et al. 2002. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:183-185). Using secondary
    structural information, we converted each sequence in the alignments
    into a sequence over a 20-symbol code: one symbol for each of the
    four individual bases, and one symbol for each of the 16 ordered
    pairs. Substitutions in the coded sequences are defined in the natural
    way, as observed changes between two sequences at any particular
    site. For given ranges (windows) of sequence divergence, we obtained
    substitution frequency matrices for the coded sequences. Using a
    technique originally developed for modeling amino acid substitutions
    ( Veerassamy, Smith, and Tillier. 2003. J. Comput. Biol. 10:997-1010),
    we were able to estimate the actual evolutionary distance for each
    window. The actual evolutionary distances were used to derive instantaneous
    rate matrices, and from these we selected a universal rate matrix.
    The universal rate matrices were incorporated into the Phylip Software
    package ( Felsenstein 2002. http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html),
    and we analyzed the ribosomal RNA alignments using both distance
    and maximum likelihood methods. The empirical substitution models
    performed well on simulated data, and produced reasonable evolutionary
    trees for 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from sequenced Bacterial genomes.
    Empirical models have the advantage of being easily implemented,
    and the fact that the code consists of 20 symbols makes the models
    easily incorporated into existing programs for protein sequence analysis.
    In addition, the models are useful for simulating the evolution of
    RNA sequence and structure simultaneously.},
