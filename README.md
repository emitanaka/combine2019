This repo contains material for COMBINE Australia NSW workshop on R
Markdown.

**The slides should be opened in Google Chrome.**

My slides are written using `xaringan` but I do not recommend studying
my source code if you are trying to learn `xaringan`. I am experimenting
with certain components and it differs signficantly from standard usage
of `xaringan`. (Feel free to talk to me about it if you want to know
more).
