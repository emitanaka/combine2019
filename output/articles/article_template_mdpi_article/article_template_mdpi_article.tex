% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\hypertarget{version}{%
\section{Version}\label{version}}

This Rmd-skeleton uses the mdpi Latex template published 2019/02.
However, the official template gets more frequently updated than the
`rticles' package. Therefore, please make sure prior to paper
submission, that you're using the most recent .cls, .tex and .bst files
(available \href{http://www.mdpi.com/authors/latex}{here}).

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and
highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work
and its significance. The current state of the research field should be
reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight
controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly
mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal
conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction
comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research.
Citing a journal paper
\citep{bertrand-krajewski_distribution_1998, leutnant_stormwater_2016}.
And now citing a book reference \citet{gujer_systems_2008}. Please use
the command \citep{leutnant_stormwater_2016} for the following MDPI
journals, which use author-date citation: Administrative Sciences, Arts,
Econometrics, Economies, Genealogy, Humanities, IJFS, JRFM, Laws,
Religions, Risks, Social Sciences.

\hypertarget{materials-and-methods}{%
\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to
allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note
that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all
materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the
publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission
stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information.
New methods and protocols should be described in detail while
well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately
cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a
publicly available database should specify where the data have been
deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession
numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please
state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided
prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies
require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval
and the corresponding ethical approval code.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise
and precise description of the experimental results, their
interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be
drawn.

perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The
findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest
context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.
