% The mathtime package uses a Times font instead of Computer Modern.
% Uncomment the line below if you wish to use the mathtime package:
%\usepackage[cmbold]{mathtime}
% Note that miktex, by default, configures the mathtime package to use commercial fonts
% which you may not have. If you would like to use mathtime but you are seeing error
% messages about missing fonts (mtex.pfb, mtsy.pfb, or rmtmi.pfb) then please see
% the technical support document at http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf
% for instructions on fixing this problem.

% Note: you may use either harvard or natbib (but not both) to provide a wider
% variety of citation commands than latex supports natively. See below.

% Uncomment the next line to use the natbib package with bibtex
\usepackage{natbib}

% Uncomment the next line to use the harvard package with bibtex
%\usepackage[abbr]{harvard}

% This command determines the leading (vertical space between lines) in draft mode
% with 1.5 corresponding to "double" spacing.

\maketitle

American Economic Review Pointers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material
before the first section heading.

\item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).

\item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.

\item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.

\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.

\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).

\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.

\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.

\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}
