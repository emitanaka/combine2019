% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers. The
abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of
the paper. It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200
words for Letters). No references should appear in the abstract.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers. See
\texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and
\texttt{mnras\_guide.tex} for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the
work in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by S.
(2013), and describes the problem the authors aim to solve N. (2012).

\hypertarget{methods-observations-simulations-etc.}{%
\section{Methods, Observations, Simulations
etc.}\label{methods-observations-simulations-etc.}}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used. It
is frequently split into subsections, such as Section \ref{maths} below.

\hypertarget{maths}{%
\subsection{Maths}\label{maths}}

Labels are auto--generated, i.e.~this one has
\texttt{\textbackslash{}label\{maths\}}.

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g.
\(2\times3=6\) or \(v=220\) km s\(^{-1}\), but more complicated
expressions should be entered as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
  x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
  \label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g.~equation (\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\hypertarget{figures-and-tables}{%
\subsection{Figures and tables}\label{figures-and-tables}}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text.
Don't worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the
publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g.~Fig. \ref{fig:example_figure}, and
tables as e.g.~Table \ref{tab:example_table}.

\begin{figure}
  % To include a figure from a file named example.*
  % Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
  % or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
  Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
  but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
  Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
  \label{tab:example_table}
  \begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
    \hline
    A & B & C & D\\
    \hline
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
    2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
    3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done,
and describe the final conclusions which the authors draw from their
work.

\hypertarget{acknowledgements}{%
\section*{Acknowledgements}\label{acknowledgements}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used
etc. Try to keep it short.

\hypertarget{references}{%
\section*{References}\label{references}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{References}

\hypertarget{refs}{}
\leavevmode\hypertarget{ref-Author2012}{}%
N., A. A. (2012) \emph{Journal of Improbable Astronomy}, 1(1).

\leavevmode\hypertarget{ref-Others2013}{}%
S., O. (2013) \emph{Journal of Interesting Stuff}, 17(198).

\appendix

\hypertarget{some-extra-material}{%
\section{Some extra material}\label{some-extra-material}}

If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the
flow of the main paper, it can be placed in an Appendix which appears
after the list of references.
