Cite fancy references (LastName1 et al., 2013). As demonstrated in
OtherAuthor and Coauthor (2012), citations can also be automatically
reference. Multiple references are separated by semicolons (LastName1 et
al., 2013; Author4 and Author5, 2013).

Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same
order as they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be
automatically embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly
ensure that each table and figure is mentioned in the text and in
numerical order. Permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted
material from other sources (including the web). Please note that it is
compulsory to follow figure instructions. Figures which are not
according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the
production process.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\hypertarget{disclosureconflict-of-interest-statement}{%
\section*{Disclosure/Conflict-of-Interest
Statement}\label{disclosureconflict-of-interest-statement}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Disclosure/Conflict-of-Interest
Statement}

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of
any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a
potential conflict of interest.

\hypertarget{author-contributions}{%
\section*{Author Contributions}\label{author-contributions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Author Contributions}

The statement about the authors and contributors can be up to several
sentences long, describing the tasks of individual authors referred to
by their initials and should be included at the end of the manuscript
before the References section.

\hypertarget{acknowledgments}{%
\section*{Acknowledgments}\label{acknowledgments}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgments}

Funding:

\hypertarget{supplemental-data}{%
\section{Supplemental Data}\label{supplemental-data}}

Supplementary Material should be uploaded separately on submission, if
there are Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same
file as the figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material templates can be found
in the Frontiers LaTeX folder

\hypertarget{references}{%
\section{References}\label{references}}

A reference list should be automatically created here. However it won't.
Pandoc will place the list of references at the end of the document
instead. There are no convenient solution for now to force Pandoc to do
otherwise. The easiest way to get around this problem is to edit the
LaTeX file created by Pandoc before compiling it again using the
traditional LaTeX commands.

\hypertarget{figures}{%
